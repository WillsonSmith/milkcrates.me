milkcrates.me is the domain I use for experiments

## Production

To build for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

A production build includes:

- Minified code bundles
- Generated Service workers
- App manifest

## Service Workers

Service workers are generated via the Stencil build tool. For more information on how they can be configured, see the [Service Worker docs](https://stenciljs.com/docs/service-workers).

## Developing with a Service Worker

For most cases, you'll want to develop your app without generating a Service Worker. But if you'd like to test out Web Push Notifications or Background Sync, you'll need to have one generated. To generate a Service Worker during dev builds, we've added the npm script:

```
npm run start.sw
```

This will start a dev build and generate a Service Worker as well.

## Unit Tests

To run the unit tests once, run:

```bash
npm test
```

To run the unit tests and watch for file changes during development, run:

```bash
npm run test.watch
```
